/*
Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . Brie can either start turning pages
from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number ), and she always
turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page
is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side
depending on the total number of pages of the book.

Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of pages in the book.
The second line contains an integer, , denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= p <= n

Output Format
Print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn to get to page p.

If Brie starts turning from page , she only needs to turn  page:

If Brie starts turning from page , she needs to turn  pages:

Because we want to print the minumum number of page turns, we print  as our answer.
